# news-category-multiclass-classification
This repository contains code and results for a multiclass classification project on a news category dataset. The goal is to classify news headlines and short descriptions into predefined categories. I have used various methods of classification; logistic regression, decision tree, knn, random forest, cnn, light gradient boosting etc.
